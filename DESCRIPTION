Description: Provides well-tested wrappers for narrow functions of several binary packages, including plink1 and plink2 (limited capabilities), gcta, bolt, gemma, and emmax.  Focuses on approaches for genetic association, population structure (kinship/GRM matrices and PCA), and heritability estimation.  Outputs are omitted unless there are errors (for easier debugging).  Parsers for the various output tables are also provided.  Complements the `genio` package (which focuses on parsing and not on binary wrappers).
