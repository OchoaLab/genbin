# genbin 0.0.0.9000 (2021-08-14)

- First version of various functions organized around this package!
  - Original (scripts in a private repository, not a proper package) was not tested systematically, and evolved slowly so many features were only partially present in newer code while older code did things in more awkward ways.
  - New code shares the way errors are handled across all cases; style is more coherent, including option names, behaviors, parsers, etc.
- This early version is thoroughly tested, but not documented at all.  No functions are exported.
